    The Autobots are one of the main factions in the <b>Transformers</b> franchise. In plain terms, Autobots are the good guys in <i>most</i> Transformer stories.
</p>

    <p id="start">
        A generally heroic group, the Autobots are devoted to protecting their home planet of Cybertron and the planets of other species from the evil Decepticons. Their mission being to keep the peace among the universe and protect the freedom of every sentient being. The alternate modes for most Autobots are non-combat vehicles like trucks, cars, or other domestic vehicles with a few exceptions among their ranks to accomodate for the reality of war. The leader of the Autobots are known as Primes. A Prime is chosen by their ability to carry an ancient mythical artifact called <i>"The Matrix of Leadership"</i>. Bots who are able to unlock the power of the Matrix are considered worthy by the Primes who came before them to light their darkest hour. A notibal trait of Primes is their size difference, being a little taller than the rest of the Autobots.

        Optimus Prime (also referred to as simply "Prime"), is the selfless leader of the Autobots. Voiced by Canadian voice actor, Peter Cullen, Optimus is a main protagonist within The Transformers. He is frequently fighting against Megatron, his archnemesis and leader of the enemy, the Decepticons. Optimus Prime transforms into a red and blue semi-truck with a trailer attached. (It kind of pops out of nowhere...)

    <p id="OP">
        His iconic weapons are his energon axe and his ion blaster. Optimus is extremely sympathetic with local life, allowing him to quickly become allies with the humans of Earth, and becomes great friends with the main human characters of Generation 1, Sparkplug and his son, Spike.
