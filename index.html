      <i>The Transformers</i> is a very broad franchise, to say the very least. Originally the 1980s Japanese toylines  <b>Diaclone</b> and <b>Micro Change</b> which featured robots who could transform into vehicles. Takara Tomy rebranded the two toylines for Western marketing. In present day, Transformers is one of the many brands under Hasbro with new continuties, toylines, and comic publishings still being made 40 years after the launch of the tv series <b>The Transformers.</b>

        <b>The Transformers</b> (also known as 
        <a href="https://tfwiki.net/wiki/Generation_1_continuity_family" target="_blank">Generation 1</a>
         
        or G1) was the original cartoon that ran from 1984 to 1987, which captured the imagination of children and the young-at-heart worldwide. <hr>The cartoon (along with the Marvel comics) set up the basic story of Transformers that most other incarnations were to follow: two warring factions of robots on the planet Cybertron leave in search of resources. The factions crash-land on Earth and, millions of years later, begin their battle anew in Reagan-era America and across the globe.

        <p> Once established, the cartoon rarely took any steps to upset its status quo. Plots generally centered on a Decepticon plot or invention of the week, which would be used to gather energy or Defeat The Autobots <i>FOREVER!!</i>, and the Autobots' efforts to stop the plan. Most of the time the Decepticons were forced into retreat, and the Autobots drove off victorious. At most, a new character or team was added to one side or the other. Plots became a bit less formulaic during Season 3, though character death and true plot upheaval remained a rarity.
